Beneath the waves of the great ocean, the ocean is a great place to live.
The ocean has been a place of great beauty for thousands of years. It is the place where the sun shines, 
and the sea is filled with beautiful, beautiful creatures. The ocean itself is full of beautiful things, 
but it is also full with the beauty of its beauty. This is why the world is so beautiful.
